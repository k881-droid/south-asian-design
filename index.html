           This project explores how South Asian design offers a unique and often underappreciated counter-narrative to Western design principles. It focuses on how South Asian aesthetics, traditions, and craftsmanship are reframing the global design landscape, especially in the context of typefaces, graphic design, and architecture. South Asian design is often rooted in cultural heritage, symbolism, and intricate craftsmanship, yet it has frequently been overlooked or appropriated in the mainstream without recognition of its origins.
